## Question

Write a program in java to accept a sentence which may be terminated by either '.' or '?' or '!' only. Any other character may be ignored. The words may be separated by more than one blank space and are in UPPER CASE. 
<br/>Perform the following tasks:
<br/>(a) Accept a sentence and remove all the extra blank spaces between the two words to a single blank space.
<br/>(b) Accept any word from the user along with its position and insert the word in the given position. (The position is calculated by place value of each word where first word is in position 1, second word in position 2 and so on).
<br/>(c) Display the modified sentence.

Test your program for the following data and some random data:

**Example 1** 
<br/>**INPUT :** MORNING WALK IS A BLESSING FOR THE WHOLE DAY.
            <br/>WORD TO BE INSERTED : TOTAL
            <br/>WORD POSITION IN THE SENTENCE : 5
<br/>**OUTPUT :** MORNING WALK IS A TOTAL BLESSING FOR THE WHOLE DAY.

**Example 2**
<br/>**INPUT :** AS YOU SOW, SO YOU REAP!
          <br/>WORD TO BE INSERTED:SHALL
         <br/>WORD POSITION IN THE SENTENCE: 5
<br/>**OUTPUT :** AS YOU SOW, SO SHALL YOU REAP!

**Example 3**
