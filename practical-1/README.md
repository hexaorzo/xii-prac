## Question

A Composite Magic number is a positive integer which is composite as well as a magic number.

Composite number: A composite number is a number that has more than two factors.
<br/> Example: 10
<br/> Factors are: 1,2,5,10

Magic number: A magic number is a number in which the eventual sum of the digits is equal to 1.
<br/> Example: 28 = 2 + 8 = 10 = 1 + 0 = 1

Accept two positive integers m and n, where m is less than n as user input. Display the number of Composite Magic integers that are in the range between m and n (both inclusive) and output them along with the frequency, in the format specified below:
<br/>Test your program for the following data and some random data.

**Example 1**
<br/> **INPUT:** m = 40
<br/> n = 100
<br/> **OUTPUT:** THE COMPOSITE MAGIC INTEGERS ARE:
<br/> 46, 55, 64, 82, 91, 100
<br/> FREQUENCY OF COMPOSITE MAGIC INTEGERS IS: 6

**Example 2**
<br/> **INPUT:** m = 1210
<br/> n = 1300
<br/> **OUTPUT:** THE COMPOSITE MAGIC INTEGERS ARE:
<br/> 1216, 1225, 1234, 1243, 1252, 1261, 1270, 1288
<br/> FREQUENCY OF COMPOSITE MAGIC INTEGERS IS: 8

**Example 3**
<br/> **INPUT:** m = 120
<br/> n = 97
<br/> **OUTPUT:** INVALID INPUT
