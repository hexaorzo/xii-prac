## Question

An integer number whose digits are arranged in ascending order from left to right is called an **Increasing Number**. At any position, the current digit is always greater than or equal to the previous digit. For example: 1233, 13689, 112334566 etc.
<br/>An integer number whose digits are arranged in descending order from left to right is called a **Decreasing Number**. At any position, the current digit is always less than or equal to the previous digit. For example: 321, 88531, 8755321 etc.
<br/>An integer number where the digits are neither in increasing or decreasing order is called a **Bouncy number**. In other words, if the digits of the Bouncy number are unsorted then it is bouncy. For example: 123742, 101, 43682 etc.

Design a program in Java to accept a number(containing only digits 0 to 9) from the user. For an invalid input, display an appropriate message. Check whether the number is an Increasing, Decreasing or a Bouncy number and display with an appropriate message in the format specified below: 

Test your program with the sample data and some random data:

**Example 1**
<br/> **INPUT:** ENTER A NUMBER : 122344
<br/> **OUTPUT:** 122344 IS AN INCREASING NUMBER.

**Example 2**
<br/> **INPUT:** ENTER A NUMBER : 887552
<br/> **OUTPUT:** 887552 IS A DECREASING NUMBER.

**Example 3**
<br/> **INPUT:** ENTER A NUMBER : 185349
<br/> **OUTPUT:** 185349 IS A BOUNCY NUMBER.

**Example 4**
<br/> **INPUT:** ENTER A NUMBER : 98#57-649
<br/> **OUTPUT:** INVALID INPUT.
