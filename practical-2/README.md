## Question

Write a program to accept a paragraph containing two sentences only. The sentences may be terminated by either '.', '?' or '!' only. Any other character may be ignored. The words are to be separated by a single blank space and are in UPPER CASE.

Perform the following tasks:
<br/> (a) Accept the paragraph and check for validity
<br/> (b) Obtain the length/size of the two sentences separately (number of words)
<br/> (c) Find the common words which occur in both the sentences

Test your program with the sample data and some random data:

**Example 1**
<br/> **INPUT:** IS IT CLOUDY? IT MAY RAIN BECAUSE IT IS CLOUDY.
<br/> **OUTPUT:**
<br/> SENTENCE 1: 3 WORDS
<br/> SENTENCE 2: 7 WORDS
<br/> COMMON WORDS: IS IT CLOUDY

**Example 2**
<br/> **INPUT:** TO BE OR NOT TO BE. TO LET GO AND BE HAPPY.
<br/> **OUTPUT:**
<br/> SENTENCE 1: 6 WORDS
<br/> SENTENCE 2: 6 WORDS
<br/> COMMON WORDS: TO BE

**Example 3**
<br/> **INPUT:** IF YOU DRIVE FAST, YOU MAY MEET WITH AN ACCIDENT.
<br/> **OUTPUT:**
<br/> INVALID PARAGRAPH

**Example 4**
